# Syntax ambiguity resolution model also is the name of MySQL table storing the samples of that model.

# When parsing by scripts, the samples of selected model would be created.

# Switch of updating syntax or category ambiguity resolution samples in database.
# For grammar inconsistancy, parsing by scripts sometimes includes manually ambiguity resolution, using new category conversion rules or syntax rules.
# On another aspects, resolution policies might be different between parsing by scripts and parsing manually.
# So, parsing by scripts might change syntax or category ambiguity resolution samples coming from a same sentence.
# When NOT hope to update syntax or category ambiguity resolution samples in database, set this switch as Off.
# Now, category ambiguity resolution model SLR samples are stored with treebank created by parsing with scripts.
# Switch category_ambig_resol_sample_update_switch is NOT used at present.
