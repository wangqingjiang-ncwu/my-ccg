# 'SLR' is one kind of category conversion ambiguity resolution model.
# In 'SLR', one [([PhraCate], [Rule])] per clause, one [[([PhraCate], [Rule])]] per sentence.
# 'treebank1' is a table storing SLR samples, in which every record has (serial_num, tree, script, SLR, tagClause), and the first 3 fields
# come from 'corpus'.

# Ambiguity resolution model, such as 'stru_gene', 'stru_gene_202408' and 'ambi_resol1', also is the name of MySQL table storing the samples of that model.
# Actually, no matter what ambiguity resolution model is selected, the model samples should exist for every sentence in treebanks.
# Model 'stru_gene' should be selected when parsing tree was creatly at the first time, then other models are selected when parsing by scripts
# with purpose that samples of those models can be obtained.
